                        <h3 class="post-subtitle">After her Freshman year, Selena took a break from school to serve a
                            mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. This would be completely
                            volunteer work that would last a year and a half. She didn’t know where God needed her, and
                            later found that the church was going to send her to serve in the Islands of Hawaii! Here
                            she had the opportunity to serve people from the Islands of Kauai, Maui, and Oahu. The
                            people, culture, and land became something very special to her and she served and came
                            closer to God. <br> <br>


                            There were many economic circumstances that the people of Hawaii had little control over.
                            One of these was the price of living. One thing we did as missionaries was serve in a
                            foodbank in order to help combat food insecurity

                        <h3 class="post-subtitle">Now back at BYU Selena has shown interest in the Marriott School of
                            Business. Specifically Experience Design and Management. This program focuses on how to
                            design, deliver, and manage impactful experiences! Every Business uses experiences, and
                            Experience design teaches how to manage experiences to increase the bottom line of the
                            company and increase customer retention. Selena’s interest in this major is connected
                            largely to her background. She grew up working where the product was an experience. She also
                            has strong connections to tourist destinations including Hawaii and Branson Missouri. Her
                            love for people, creativity, and problem solving makes ExDM highly compatible for her.
                            Selena hopes to get into the major this summer. </h3>
